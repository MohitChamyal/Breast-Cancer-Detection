# Breast Cancer Classification🧬🔍

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning techniques. It leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and applies various models to identify the most accurate approach.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, available through `sklearn.datasets`. It contains features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

- Features: 30 real-valued features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area)
- Target: Diagnosis (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## 📈 Key Results

After comparing the performance of all models, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
